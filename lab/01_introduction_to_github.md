# Introduction to GitHub
**Duration:** 10 minutes

GitHub provides an AI-powered developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. Whether you’re planning new features, fixing bugs, or collaborating on changes, GitHub is where over 100 million developers from across the globe come together to create things and make them even better.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git, a distributed version control system, at its core. The GitHub platform simplifies the process of collaborating on projects and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together.

Let’s break down each one of the core pillars of the GitHub Enterprise platform:

### AI
Generative AI is dramatically transforming software development as we speak. The GitHub Enterprise platform is enhancing collaboration through AI-powered pull requests and issues, productivity through Copilot, and security by automating security checks faster.

### Collaboration
Collaboration is at the core of everything GitHub does. We know inefficient collaboration results in wasted time and money. We counteract that with a suite of seamless tools that allow collaboration to happen effortlessly.

### Productivity
Productivity is accelerated with automation that the GitHub Enterprise Platform provides. With built-in CI/CD tools directly integrated into the workflow, the platform gives users the ability to set tasks and forget them, taking care of routine administration, and speeding up day-to-day work. This gives your developers more time to focus on what matters most: creating innovative solutions.

### Security
GitHub focuses on integrating security directly into the development process from the start. GitHub Enterprise platform includes native, first-party security features that minimize security risk with a built-in security solution. Plus, your code remains private within your organization, and at the same time you are able to take advantage of security overview and Dependabot.

### Scale
In essence, the GitHub Enterprise Platform focuses on the developer experience. It has the scale to provide industry-changing insights, collaboration capabilities for transformative efficiency, the tools for increased productivity, security at every step, and AI to power it all to new heights in a single, integrated platform.
